# AltDistributions.jl

*Alternate parameterisations extension for Distributions.jl*

Sometimes you need to use an alternate parameterisation for a distribution and it isn't available directly in Distributions.jl.
Similarly, you may need to apply some general heuristics to a distribution (e.g., 80% of the time the delay is between x and y).
Use AltDistributions.jl to help with the formulation.
